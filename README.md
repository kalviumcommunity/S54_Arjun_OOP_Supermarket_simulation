# **Supermarket Store Simulation**

## üìö **Project Description**

The **Supermarket Store Simulation** is a console-based Java application that models a simple supermarket environment, including products and customers. The simulation allows customers to add products to their shopping lists, view product details, and manage the store inventory.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java while simulating real-world interactions within a supermarket. Key OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, static variables, dynamic memory allocation, and constructors are implemented to structure and manage data effectively.

## ‚ö° **Key Features**

- **Product and Customer Management**:
  - **Products**: Create products with attributes like name, price, and expiry date (for perishable items).
  - **Customers**: Manage customer information, including a shopping list for each customer.

- **Inventory Tracking**:
  - Track the total number of products and customers using static variables.
  - Display all product and customer details for easy monitoring.

- **Robust OOP Structure**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Product and customer attributes are managed with getter and setter methods for secure data handling.
  - **Static Variables and Methods**: Count the total number of products and customers using static variables and provide access through static methods.
  - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Objects are created at runtime, managing memory dynamically.
  - **Constructors**: Both default and parameterized constructors initialize objects effectively.

## üìù **Usage**

### Features in Action

Once the project is running, you‚Äôll see the following actions:

- **Product Creation**: Products are created with attributes like `name` and `price`. Perishable items have an additional `expiryDays` attribute.
- **Customer Interaction**: Customers can add products to their shopping lists and view their lists.
- **Static Counters**: The total number of products and customers is tracked and displayed using static variables.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add features like total price calculation for each customer‚Äôs shopping list.
- Implement a checkout and payment system.
- Introduce discount and promotion management for specific products.
- Expand product categories to include various supermarket items.
